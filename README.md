# packagetemplate

This repository is meant to be a template for initializing a Python package with the requisite files. The package itself does not do much, as it simply contains two functions that return `Hello world!` and the reduced Planck constant. However, it should be a good starting point for users who wish to create Python packages and do not want to have to create the needed files themselves.

To use this as a template, please click on the green "Use this template" button.
